//! The core state machine bridging document sections and the interactive editor.
//!
//! A TUI needs a single source of truth that can be interrogated and mutated as the user navigates
//! and edits. We achieve this by syncing the editor save state with the files on disk. We keep
//! track of the cumulative total number of lines that have been added to the file during the
//! session so that we can determine the correct offset to insert content at without re-parsing.

/// Determines navigation scope and quit behavior based on project size.

pub enum FileMode {
    /// Single-file mode quits directly to shell.
    Single,
    /// Multi-file mode shows file tree in list view.
    Multi,
}
